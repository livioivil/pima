# Post-selection Inference in Multiverse Analysis

Runs resampling-based tests jointly to allow for multiple testing in
multiverse analysis. As main feature, it applies the PIMA procedure, a
general and flexible framework based on the sign-flip score test that
provides control of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) and confidence
bounds for True Discovery Proportions (TDPs).

## Details

The starting point of the package is the
[`pima`](https://livioivil.github.io/pima/reference/pima.md) function.
See examples there.
