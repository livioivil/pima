\title{Specification Curve Analysis}
\usage{
spec_curve(res, alpha = 0.05, p.values = c("adjusted", "raw"))
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A list object with regression model results, including `mods` (a list of models) and `summary_table` (a data frame containing estimates and p-values).}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value specifying the significance level for the confidence intervals. Default is 0.05.}

\item{p.values}{A char string indicating which type of p-values to use. Options are `"raw"` or `"adjusted"` (default). In both cases, they are taken from the `summary_table`.}
}
\value{
A plot displaying the specification curve with confidence intervals and p-values, as well as a legend showing the variable combinations used in each specification.
}
\description{
This function performs a specification curve analysis based on the results of a set of regression models. It visualizes the coefficient estimates with confidence intervals, p-values, and highlights significant specifications.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (assuming `res` is a pre-computed result object):
# spec_curve(res, alpha = 0.05)
