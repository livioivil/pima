Description: Runs resampling-based tests jointly to allow for multiple testing in multiverse analysis, providing weak and strong control of the Family-Wise Error Rate and True Discovery Proportions. As main feature, it applies the PIMA procedure, a general and flexible framework based on the sign-flip score test. Details can be found in Girardi et al. (2024) <doi:10.1007/s11336-024-09973-6>.
